Reference types are used to store complex objects
  -- like date, mail message

any type not listed as a primitive type is a reference type.

# NOTES on copying reference types versus primitive types:
Reference type variables do not store values, but actually store the
references (memory location) of the object in memory

Reference types are copied by their references, whereas primitive types are
  copied by their value.  That is, for primitive types, the values are completely
   independent of each other
